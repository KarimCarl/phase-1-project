# Phase-1-Project


## Country Lister

This country lister app displays information about a country that the user chooses to input in the search bar.
The app uses a free API.
For this app to run, you first have to run your json database by running json-server --watch db.json.
Once the server is launched, you can run open the index.html file. 
You can then proceed to click any animal from the characters outlined, for example, Zebra or Lion.
Once selected, a GIF of the selected animal will play at the image section.
You can then add the number of votes to the animal you have selected. To save the votes, you have to click'Add Votes.'
After inputing your votes, you can then add some more votes which will be cumulatively added to the previous number of votes.
Do this repetitively until you have enough votes for your selected animals.
You can then reset the votes for an animal back to zero by clicking 'Reset Votes.'




## Conclusion
This ask the user to input a country of theirchoice. The app then retrieves information from a remoted db and displays it to the user. Not all information is new and up-to-date but it gives a failry latest update. This was a very challenging project as I'm still learning Js but I will try to practise more and hopefully make more complicated projects.
