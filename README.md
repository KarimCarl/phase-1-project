# Phase-1-Project


## Challenge

We will be working on Flataculties, an app where you can vote for the cutest animal! You will use a local API and build out the frontend for our app, Flatacuties.
For this app to run, you first have to run your json database by running json-server --watch db.json.
Once the server is launched, you can run open the index.html file. 
You can then proceed to click any animal from the characters outlined, for example, Zebra or Lion.
Once selected, a GIF of the selected animal will play at the image section.
You can then add the number of votes to the animal you have selected. To save the votes, you have to click'Add Votes.'
After inputing your votes, you can then add some more votes which will be cumulatively added to the previous number of votes.
Do this repetitively until you have enough votes for your selected animals.
You can then reset the votes for an animal back to zero by clicking 'Reset Votes.'




## Conclusion
This app takes in votes from the users and adds them to the animal you've selected. Clicking the reset button will reset the selected animal's vote back to zero. Implementing this using DOM was hard since it was a new concept that we had almost zero knowledge of how to tackle it.
