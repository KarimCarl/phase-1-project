# Phase-1-Project

Welcome to the Country Lister repository! This repository is for Moringa School's Phase 1 project. This is a simple single-page application that allows you to search and view different countries using free available data online.

## Country Lister

This country lister app displays information about a country that the user chooses to input in the search bar.
The app uses a free API.
To run this app, you need to open index.html file.Once the browser is open, you can search any country you'd like. 
Once you have input the country of your choice, brief details of the country like the flag, currency and population pops up.


## Conclusion
This ask the user to input a country of theirchoice. The app then retrieves information from a remoted db and displays it to the user. Not all information is new and up-to-date but it gives a failry latest update. This was a very challenging project as I'm still learning Js but I will try to practise more and hopefully make more complicated projects.
